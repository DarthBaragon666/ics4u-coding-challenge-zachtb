### Julia Set
The Julia set is basically a piece of the Mandelbrot set. Instead of continuously generating a ‘C’ value, we use a constant. The constant has a Real component, and a Complex component. The X-Axis represents ‘A’, and the Y-axis represents ‘B’. For example, for a specific Julia Set, we have 2 parts to the constant. The ‘C’ value then becomes part of this recursive formula: 
Z0=0
Z1=Z02+C
Z2=Z12+C
Z3=Z22+C
Z4=Z32+C

Deliverables:

1. The code for each of your projects: Each person in the team is responsible for creating their own copy of the challenge.
2. Plan for your Coding Challenge. (Breakdown how the 90 minutes will be used)
3. Collecting Created challenges by participants.
4. Anything created live. (if you made something live, include it after)
5. a README.md file that explains the coding challenge.
6. Any notes/slides created (google or github)
7. Link to repository if it was created in another repository.

Notes:
* You must use the project board to maintain the status of your project.
* You must use your wiki page to explain your project
* Each person must have their own original version of the challenge with one creative twist(Algorithmic is level 3 or object oriented is level 4)
* You must make a significant connection to:
    1. Creative coding(explaining to the class how they can incorporate this into their workflow as a learner of technology)
    2. One research article that connects to computer science.
    3. One aspect of emerging technology that is highlighted and briefly touched uppn.
