### Julia Set
The Julia set is basically a piece of the Mandelbrot set. Instead of continuously generating a ‘C’ value, we use a constant. The constant has a Real component, and a Complex component. The X-Axis represents ‘A’, and the Y-axis represents ‘B’. For example, for a specific Julia Set, we have 2 parts to the constant. The ‘C’ value then becomes part of this recursive formula: 
* Z0=0
* Z1=Z02+C
* Z2=Z12+C
* Z3=Z22+C
* Z4=Z32+C

### Sets
A set in math is a collection of objects (ex. People, letters, numbers, etc...).

### Pixels
In its broadest terms, a pixel is a mappable position, for example, on a screen. To map this position, we use computer science. So, relating this idea back to the Mandelbrot Set and the Julia Sets, we can see that a pixel is made up from the ‘A’ and the ‘B’ values of the ‘C’ value. Remember that the complex plane is this: 
The X-Axis is the real number component and the Y-Axis is Imaginary component. Plotting this Complex Number reveals a pixel of the Julia Set.
The understanding of a pixel in the Julia Set and the Mandelbrot set can be applied to displays. A physical pixel in a display is mapped by a point in columns and rows. By looking at what is stored in a particular point in the set of pixels reveals the RGB information. 

### Emerging Technology
* Currently used to visualize the complex plane
* [Generating more cat pictures](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/fractal-kitties-illustrate-the-endless-possibilities-for-julia-sets/) if the internet ever runs out (using the julia set to approximate an objects outline)
* [Digital signature scheme](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8cd5/e8365d55180a236a6dd6a5a212dddae318bd.pdf) based on Mandelbrot and Julia fractal sets (Proposed but not yet actualized)

Deliverables:

1. The code for each of your projects: Each person in the team is responsible for creating their own copy of the challenge.
2. Plan for your Coding Challenge. (Breakdown how the 90 minutes will be used)
3. Collecting Created challenges by participants.
4. Anything created live. (if you made something live, include it after)
5. a README.md file that explains the coding challenge.
6. Any notes/slides created (google or github)
7. Link to repository if it was created in another repository.

Notes:
* You must use the project board to maintain the status of your project.
* You must use your wiki page to explain your project
* Each person must have their own original version of the challenge with one creative twist(Algorithmic is level 3 or object oriented is level 4)
* You must make a significant connection to:
    1. Creative coding(explaining to the class how they can incorporate this into their workflow as a learner of technology)
    2. One research article that connects to computer science.
    3. One aspect of emerging technology that is highlighted and briefly touched uppn.
